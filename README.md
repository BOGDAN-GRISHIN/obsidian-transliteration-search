# Obsidian Smart Search Plugin

This is an Obsidian plugin for those who prefer to search files not so much fuzzy. Moreover..

- `Smart Search` can search **regardless of the appearance order of tokens**
- `Smart Search` shows file names and directory names separately
- `Smart Search` shows suggestions order by prioritizing both last opened time and modified time **even after typing**

## ‚å®Ô∏èFeatures

### Normal Search

Run `Smart Search: Normal search` on `Command palette` or push `Ctrl + Shift + P`.

### Recent Search

Run `Smart Search: Recent search` on `Command palette` or push `Ctrl + Shift + E`.

If the query starts with `/`, it behaves as `Normal Search`.

### Backlink Search

Run `Smart Search: Backlink search` on `Command palette` or push `Ctrl + Shift + H`.

‚ö†Ô∏èThis feature is an experimental feature. And it has unsafe implementation, so there are risks it is not working someday :)
