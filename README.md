This is an Obsidian plugin which is another choice of Quick switcher.

- It can create custom search commands (`Custom searches`)
- It allows you to customize the hotkeys in the quick switcher to your preference
- It can search backlinks and move them **without leaving from a keyboard** (`Backlink search`)
- It can move a file to another folder (`Move file to another folder`)
- It can search **regardless of the appearance order of tokens**
- It **only searches Markdown files** except for the case of `Move file to another folder`
- It does not search very fuzzy (e.g. searching for `201` doesn't match `2.01`) 
- It can search to **consider prefix emoji**
- It shows file names and directory names separately

## ‚è¨ Install

You can download from `Community plugins` in Obsidian settings.
