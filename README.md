This is an Obsidian plugin which is another choice of Quick switcher.

- `Another Quick Switcher` can search **regardless of the appearance order of tokens**
- `Another Quick Switcher` shows suggestions order by prioritizing both last opened time and modified time **even after typing**
- `Another Quick Switcher` can search backlinks and move them **without leaving from a keyboard**
- `Another Quick Switcher` can search to **consider prefix emoji**.
- `Another Quick Switcher` does not search very fuzzy
- `Another Quick Switcher` shows file names and directory names separately

At the moment, there are only a few options. However, if you would like to customize behavior, I will add options to make it better as well as I can :)

## ‚å®Ô∏èFeatures

### Normal Search

Run `Another Quick Switcher: Normal search` on `Command palette` or push `~~~~Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`.

### Recent Search

Run `Another Quick Switcher: Recent search` on `Command palette` or push `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + E`.

If the query starts with `/`, it behaves as `Normal Search`.

### Backlink Search

Run `Another Quick Switcher: Backlink search` on `Command palette` or push `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + H`.

## ‚è¨ Install

Download 3 files from a [Releases page].

- `main.js`

- `manifest.json`

And copy to directory, `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-another-quick-switcher/`.

‚Ñπ I'm hoping to upload it as `Community plugins` when it's a bit more stable, just a moment, please :)
