This is an Obsidian plugin which is another choice of Quick switcher.
- It can search **regardless of the appearance order of tokens**
- It shows suggestions order by prioritizing both last opened time and modified time **even after typing** (`Recent search`)
- It can search backlinks and move them **without leaving from a keyboard** (`Backlink search`)
- It can search **by tags** even if queries don't start with `#`
  - When you input queries start with `#`, It priors tag
- It can move a file to another folder (`Move file to another folder`)
- It can search to **consider prefix emoji**
- It **only searches Markdown files** except for the case of `Move file to another folder`
- It does not search very fuzzy
- It shows file names and directory names separately

At the moment, there are only a few options. However, if you would like to customize behavior, I will add options to make it better as well as I can :)
