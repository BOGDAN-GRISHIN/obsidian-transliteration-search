# Obsidian Another Quick Switcher Plugin

This is an Obsidian plugin for those who prefer to search files not so much fuzzy. Moreover..

- `Another Quick Switcher` can search **regardless of the appearance order of tokens**
- `Another Quick Switcher` shows file names and directory names separately
- `Another Quick Switcher` shows suggestions order by prioritizing both last opened time and modified time **even after typing**

## ‚å®Ô∏èFeatures

### Normal Search

Run `Another Quick Switcher: Normal search` on `Command palette` or push `Ctrl + Shift + P`.

### Recent Search

Run `Another Quick Switcher: Recent search` on `Command palette` or push `Ctrl + Shift + E`.

If the query starts with `/`, it behaves as `Normal Search`.

### Backlink Search

Run `Another Quick Switcher: Backlink search` on `Command palette` or push `Ctrl + Shift + H`.
