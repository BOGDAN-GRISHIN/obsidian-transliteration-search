This is an Obsidian plugin which is another choice of Quick switcher.

- `Another Quick Switcher` can search **regardless of the appearance order of tokens**
- `Another Quick Switcher` shows suggestions order by prioritizing both last opened time and modified time **even after typing** (Recent search)
- `Another Quick Switcher` can search backlinks and move them **without leaving from a keyboard** (Backlink search)
- `Another Quick Switcher` can search to **consider prefix emoji**.
- `Another Quick Switcher` **only searches Markdown files**.
- `Another Quick Switcher` does not search very fuzzy
- `Another Quick Switcher` shows file names and directory names separately

At the moment, there are only a few options. However, if you would like to customize behavior, I will add options to make it better as well as I can :)
